    "# Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications."

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "Now, you know how to use BERTopic for topic modeling. The results are very encouraging, and do not hesitate to give it a try on your business case. However, it is important to note that the results of BERTopic are not consistent between runs, this is due to the stochastic nature of UMAP used for dimensionality reduction. \n",

You could argue that the patriarchy as a system has built a society that causes a lot of mental distress for men. The patriarchy hurts men and women and everyone in between in nuanced ways. Feminists don't hate men. Well some do and they might be valid for it (they've experienced gender based violence and are only reacting to this harsh reality they live in), but I think the most progressive feminism strives for liberating ALL GENDERS!!!!! label: Not Cyberbullying\n",

TayTay is famous because her very wealthy father forced her into influential circles.  She then was able to build a national brand that had a target demographic of younger women.  It's just what her marketing scheme was.  Beyonce had the same exposure coming out of Destiny's child, however that was on merit.  The target demographic was always the same.  Rihanna has collaborated more broadly, touches on more expansive topics, and as a result has a wider demographic of fans.  It's not rocket science.  Each did what was successful for them, but at the end of the day the marketing schemes are what makes the world go round. On top of which TayTay went hard in the paint by going after the feminist crowd by hanging around with Lena Dunham and having her plug the Taytay brand.  \n",

Meritocracy is important, but some jobs would do good to be more diverse (especially jobs that work with people/the public, like doctors or teachers), and meritocracy should be first, then diversity and everything else after that should be second. Basically, meritocracy above all else. Take a teacher for example. \n",

The man has met all required teaching qualifications, has a clean criminal record, and has a good teacher personality. The woman has met all qualifications, but has multiple dui and drug charges, and is a total jerkwad of a person. You would choose the man, even though it does not increase diversity, because that is meritocracy. \n",

Women, especially privileged white women, enter the workforce later, leave it sooner, work part time instead of full time, and when working full time, turn down overtime. As a result, white women work about half as many hours as white men, as most of them don't work at all. The idea that they work the same amount as men is a popular myth that is easily refuted by extensive workforce data.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to housework, there is a small disparity but the data is not available, because housework is not reported on taxes, so data relies self reported number. I dispute the disparity is nearly as great as they say, because I know from experience, women tend to count certain activities as \"work\", when men do not count the same activities as work, but as leisure. For example, women purchase about four times the amount of clothes as men, in dollars, and so they consequently have more clothes to manage, tend, organize, et cetera. They typically count it as \"work\", but it's actually just a hobby they've made out of fashion. When men put away laundry, they call it their day off. \n",

      "\n",
      "There also a huge difference, when an adult is unemployed, sitting around the house. They find them doing all kinds of tasks that could possibly be considered work. But if they simply left the home and earned a paycheck, none of those tasks would have to be performed. For example, they eat some food, and then there is a plate to wash. But if they simply hadn't been at home, they wouldn't have eaten the food, and they wouldn't have washed the plate. That's where most of the disparity comes from. \n",

      "In Ancient times, Ancient Greece for instance, we don't realize there was no law outside the walls of the city. Any man walking around outside the surrounding of a city could be killed. The only thing you could do was to organize a military expedition to avenge him. Same of course with women. And the worst is, any group of armed men or any other city could attack your city, kill all the males and take women and children in slavery. That's why a citizen was only someone who could defend the city. If you ask yourself why women weren't, I think it's very obvious. Moreover, there weren't really police forces inside cities all the way until around the XVIIIth century. In Ancient cities, you needed to be organized, women for instance, had to go to the market in numbers, etc. No one was totally safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the middle ages, we have to realize that there was no individual rights. Society just wasn't built around that. It was seen as a pyramidal structure starting from God on top and going down all the way to ordinary people, who were almost all peasants, agriculturists. Nobles' rights were of divine authority, replacing divine \"temporal\" powers, and ecclesiastic hierarchy replacing \"spiritual\" powers from God. There wasn't any question of people's rights, of vote, etc. We had to fight for century not only to obtain more rights, but even to develop the notion that people were persons that *should have* rights. Countless men died in these conflicts. This notion appears mostly in the 1500s with the united State (not the US; I mean the notion of a country, if you will, which was also absent before). We kept on fighting everywhere to get more social rights, more democracy (rights for everyone) in the following centuries. At the time of the beginning of WW1 only one of the belligerents was a Republic: France. All others were still monarchies and principalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, by then, democracy was slowly emerging or had emerged. But despite what we're told about men having the right to vote excluding women just isn't true. Only men who had a capital could vote in most countries! The vote for men was far from being universal! Moreover, rights at work were horrendous. Most men worked 16 hours a day, 6 days a week! So, socially, we had to fight some more to get good work and social laws, and real equal rights, which finally came somewhere between the two WW only. Feminists of the XIXth century who demanded rights were doing so at the time when many ordinary men couldn't vote themselves. They were women from wealthier background who wanted the same rights as their wealthy husbands. And that's why Feminists always asked for a right to *a career*, something 80-90% of men never had (because what most of us have are \"jobs\", not careers!). You can easily argue that these women obtained the rights for most woman to be slave to a job like most of us men, the right *not* to raise their kids and to *not* create a home anymore, like they used to, which was so precious. But I'm not sure a majority of women would have agreed with that at the time. As to the right to vote, universal vote for men only preceded women's vote by a few decades (2, 3, 4, a bit longer in the US and France), certainly not *centuries*, as you ridiculously often hear from Feminists.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would also add to this all, that the idea women never had any voice in society is totally absurd. Women always raised kids! They always, *always* were largely responsible for the socialization of every kid, boys and girls! If they had been as unhappy as Feminists are insinuating they were, we would have known. But no, they were living with their time, with the values of their time, like the rest of us. Moreover, anyone who has a bit of experience with relationships knows that women always take their places. They voiced their points of view. They always have. And they also fully participated in their own realm to the trials and tribulations of their time. Women were never slaves of men!\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, this story so often repeated that men could beat their wives is only partially true. When a man in a village (where most of people lived in the past, until the XXth century) was not taking care of his family or was too violent, he often was shunned, and often even punished himself. Women beater were often whipped publicly, or pilloried. We have to realize that society was extremely brutal in most of our past, punishment was often very, *very* harsh, and both men and women who were found to have an improper conduct were punished severely. Once again, you have to put yourself back in context.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've already wrote too much, here, probably largely out of the realm of the question asked. I'd just say in conclusion that to me, it's not so much that Feminism as a call for equality was bad. It wasn't. It's what we always all wanted. The problem is more how Feminists are trying and succeeding in twisting our sense of reality, all the way into our sense of history, and even in sciences, biology, evolution, anatomy, sociology, almost all in pure complaint, lament, holler and cry. So much so that honest, weighted, measured debates seem to be excluded. *That*, to me, is the main problem. label: Not Cyberbullying\n",

Those are the issues that needs to be addressed. Not women becoming \"less feminine.\" label: Not Cyberbullying\n",

What if one of the women who has a terrible negative impact on him is *me* because I continue to perpetuate beliefs, intentionally or not, that - to use a popular phrase - all men are trash (yes ALL men?)

I let it all go and got my balls back, my strength back, and my understanding of the truth back without feeling obligated to be a male feminist or else get \"attacked.\" Now I set boundaries, ignore women that don't respect me, block numbers and social contact, stopped being a simp, started practicing my developed wisdom, and got ahold of my self-respect and I know what things I refuse to tolerate.

Not having sex doesn’t mean we’re not getting off either manually or with toys, I’m an at least once a day person minimum when my depression isn’t spiking. Also some risk factors and reasonings you didn’t mention: pregnancy not everyone wants that for various reasons, if someone is a casual dater or has casual sex you also likely won’t know your partner’s hygiene practices which poses higher uti risk if their hygiene practices aren’t good, not so much necessarily a risk factor but one those I know with a much higher body count than me complain about is with the casual stuff especially is not getting off so that may deter some as well. Some of us also just aren’t into the casual stuff at all. Definitely won’t dispute the other things because you’re right about testosterone which is why women tend to be more horny close to their period when their testosterone levels rise though there may be shame involved in wanting period sex or their partner may have that as a hard no. label: Not Cyberbullying\n",

I am most fulfilled when the social and financial consequences for being female and having the ability to get pregnant do not conflict clearly with my personal development and fulfillment.  I am most at peace when the social prescription for each and every aspect of my life and personhood does not conflict with achieving the aforementioned list in my first sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sweeping generalizations are harmful, even when I use them, and just because my body has the capacity to become pregnant and bear children does not mean I am personally suited for childbearing physically or the resulting baby emotionally, physically, or otherwise. Women have no innate caregiving skills, they have no jump on men in that realm. Women are no better caregivers, emotional laborers, or better at domestic labor than men are. Each of us have to independently learn and hone those skills, and, as you might imagine, being obligately given the roles that comprise these tasks based on your gender is frustrating and alienating. For me personally, I can both serve those roles and do them well. However, those are not the roles that match my skillsets, knowledge base, or my personal goals and abilities. \n",
      "\n",
      " Furthermore, I cannot be asked to set aside entirely my ambitions, desires, and capacity for personal development and fulfillment just so I can fulfill a supposed biological impetus. It is difficult for me to ignore what happens to a woman's life's trajectory, finances, time, work/career, ambitions, and ultimately well-being when they do bear children in the context of this culture/society. She gets placed immediately into the roles I described above which do not serve anyone in those roles personally. \n",
      "\n",
      "The commonality there is that what women are relegated to are all giving roles, unpaid, yet still immensely laborious and still very much work. These roles placed on us operate in reverse to the goal of improving the woman's quality of life and personal development as she sees it. Instead, women are encouraged to continue to give and work behind the scenes in the private sphere so that others may better succeed by her work--her children or spouse or community at large--at the great expense of herself. \n",
      "\n",
      "No human who is expected to and in action gives all that is good of themselves (sexual and reproductive, domestic unpaid labor, emotional labor, childcare, self-sacrifice, time) will end up being content or fulfilled, unless to give these things was thier original goal for their own lives and pivotal for their personal happiness. For me, it is not enough. These roles are all necessary basic functions of healthy life and family, but they are non-autonomous and mundane work tasks that take no particular skill, involve no problem-solving or building, and do not take innovation nor help you learn or hone skills while doing them. They're just that... These \"female\" tasks are very necessary but dull, do not contribute to personal development or success, statistically lead to depression in the individual who finds themselves consumed with only this kind of unpaid, non-autonomous routine work, and are uncompensated and generally unsavory. This kind of work also never ends, there is no final completion of these tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love to work and be busy, but there are two distinctive types of work--autonomous work involving problem solving, building, learning, growing, development, and well, autonomy. This kind of work provides the opportunity for a sense of accomplishment and personal development. It also is the kind of work that can elicit compensation. What's odd about the fact women shoulder the vast majority of the other, non-autonomous kind of work is the fact that both men and women are equally capable of doing these more unsavory, routine, mindless work tasks for both themselves and for others. At any rate, a person whom is meant to work endlessly on that kind of work alone is working not for thier own successes, but only for that of others, and as a result they will be neither personally happy nor fulfilled.\n",
      "\n",
      " I cannot just be \"happy\" with and accept that the social, financial, physical, psychological, and opportunistic hurdles and inequity that I face in acheiving the goals in my first sentence are entirely biologically prescribed. To me, that would be akin to saying, \"you could have been happy and you've got the capacity to develop personally in an upward manner... but you cannot because you are female and meant to place yourself aside for the benefit of everyone else.\" It bears mentioning that I don't think my complaints are selfish, because if it were, then no man or woman should ever hold a desire to build, grow, learn, achieve, and be pleased without risking being selfish. It is also my belief that the hurdles I face as a female attempting to rise to the limits of my own capacity in this society are not biological in origin. The challenges I face are very real, but I can conceive vividly of a world where they need not exist. \n",
      "\n",
      "So am I to have the additional, unique hurdles I face as a result of my femaleness in acheiving my goals both invalidated and minimized?I struggle to squish myself into so small a box that I would be able to become happy with and accept the societally-prescribed \"easier path of least resistance\", that is, the stifling and inhibiting social prescription for women. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now this isn't my point and is only related to the topic, but I would be remiss to not mention the stark contrast I observe while I witness my male counterparts not having to face these hurdles. In fact, I've been raised as a woman, which means in this culture...and for some reason...that your entire purpose in life is to give everything you have and all your labor for the successes of others at the expense of yourself. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's what this communicates to me: \"Keep your opinions, your pain and struggles, and your ideas small, and quiet. Keep your emotions in (as if emotional intelligence were weakness) but it is also your job to avail yourself to each and every person who approaches you with emotional struggles so you can perform emotional labor for them. If you express your opinions, feelings, desires, or needs you are not passionate or struggling. You're instead somehow just a miserable bitch. Aim to please, but not yourself. You're selfish or a bad mother if you strive for personal development and fulfillment, and in doing so are taking time and potentially augmented success away from your child, and your partner, and your family when you take of your limited time for yourself. Because you can and have had a baby, now you deserve the punative social, personal, physical and financial consequences for doing so. If you were not such a selfish, miserable cunt then you could find a man to bridge the gap for you, to provide for you when you desperately just want to be able to provide and succeed for yourself and to eliminate the asymmetrical hurdles and unmet needs continually mounting for you in light of your supposed responsibilities to others.\" \n",

Women often want to have yet more babies. Only perverted guys have asked to be kicked hard in the balls even once. It’s very convenient that we don’t have well-defined units for pain, and that no one is going to both have a baby *and* get kicked in the balls in their lifetime, so it’s possible to make bullshit claims while having no one who can *directly* attest to this either way. \n",

Not as a way of excusing sexual harassment. But while most people use it innocently, there will always be some people who say it to excuse inappropriate actions of boys.

      "text: I’ve seen first hand women who pride themselves on being bitches. I wish how I could somehow explain to them that being a selfish, materialistic, entitled cunt isn’t the same as being a strong, confident women. I’ve seen women lying to boyfriends about their work in the sex industry, rinsing guys with learning difficulties for all their money, getting nuclear revenge on guys for the slightest infraction. I knew a girl well in the UK who was in a long term loving relationship with this guy and he knew she worked in the sex industry but it was on the understanding that she would go with anonymous paying clients. When I was on tour with her in London managing the profiles and phones which get incredibly busy I arranged for her to have a 6 extremely well hung black guys to Fuck her for free as that was what she wanted me to do because it was like her dream fantasy. To clarify I simply worked for them like a personal assistant so I wouldn’t question what they asked me to do. I filmed it for her too at her request. So I was in the room filming as she was getting destroyed by these huge black Cock’s and ejaculated all over by them. As a guy I couldn’t help but feel bad for her boyfriend but like I said this was my job but I’m not Slut shaming here, the point I want to make is that a few weeks later he was telling her about some women who got talking to him when he was shopping for food but he told them all about his girlfriend and how much he loved her and he was really proud of the fact that he was a loyal and loving boyfriend. When she heard this all she heard was that he was talking to other women when she wasn’t there. She went ballistic on him, kicked him out and totally made him sufferer for daring to talk to other women even though he was just telling them how great his girlfriend was. So this is the point I’m making, when women proudly exclaim they are bitches what they mean is that they will take as much as they can get for themselves but have zero qualms about double standards or hypocrisy when it comes to how they treat men. She happily let herself get gangbanged by loads of hung black guys she didn’t even know and he was the bad one just for telling some women who approached him that he was happily in love with his girlfriend. People might say that working with those kind of girls would give me a very unrealistic reflection of women as whole but what they don’t know is how many ordinary, educated, employed women came to me to get set up and try it out for a while and then asked me to help them remove any trace of them ever having done this. I know a woman who was a real estate agent in London and did a days full Sex webcamming with me to get set up and learn the ropes so she could do it herself but then a few months later she was getting engaged to a guy to get married and texted me to ask that I delete everything for her. I don’t care who you think your girlfriend/wife is now if she thinks being a bitch is a good thing or she’s got that “girls run the world” attitude then she’s exactly like every single girl I ever met who wanted me to set up their profiles, email and phone numbers so they could do sex work. They may only do it for a few days and then never come back to it but they could do 8 to 12 clients a day and get over £1000 ($1234) in cash, tax free, per day. A decent handbag is around 600 to 1000 and shows is around 300 to 600 and almost modern every girl wants to own at least one designer pair of each.

It is only true if others say it is true. Another example is whether you live at a certain address. Or whether you are a dentist. Or whether you are trusted or distrusted. Or whether you are a well reputed person or an ill reputed person. They are true if people say they are true.\n",

So there are indeed occasions in which depraved men in unnatural social settings sometimes use other men or boys in the manner that women or girls are normally used. In those situation, it is customary to also refer to such men in a different way, because they have a different social order and different social roles, neither the role of men, nor exactly the role of women, but something different from both If you like, you could even call it a different \"gender\", to distinguish it from the common order and role men take.

We also have to keep in mind that the ruling class benefit from the status quo.

Feminism seems to have no idea just how much men can be oppressed by other men. Women have a moderate in-group bias, so they prefer women over men and treat women better than men, while men have a weak out-group bias, so men also prefer women over men and treat women better than men, albeit weekly. The end result is that everyone cares about women and nobody cares about men.\n",

Women will do the same to other women as well, but when there is no competition, women treat women as a group better than men treat men as a group, and feminism is deliberately blind to this.

However, popular media/culture seems to have excellent rebuttals to MGTOW-like ideology and less for FGTOW. Since I value a balance, that means that a lot of my observations/opinions regarding popular media/culture come across as anti-feminist when what I'm really trying to say is that the average person is only 50%-ish capable of dealing with the world around them and that we all need each other and we need to respect each other's contributions and requirements in society.\n",

It wants to solve female weakness by telling women to be more masculinie and be less caring, less motherly, and less pleasant, which are exactly the traits men generally love and value in women. Simultaneously it tells men to be more meek, emotional, caring, and \"feminine\" in order to combat what they call toxic masculinity, but it also often emasculates men and makes those men no longer attractive to women overall. It says we need to stop body-shaming and virgin-shaming women, but the vast majority of feminists I've seen online seem to have absolutely no problems with body-shaming men and calling them incels, which is basically the male equivalent of virgin shaming.\n",

It's extremely ironic because these are all things feminism claims men have done to women and that they're there to fix it.

      "text: I don’t know that I can give you the best advice on how to fix this but I think I can help clear things up for you. You’re right, it is hatred plain and simple. Everyone sees this as an inherently negative view and that’s to each their own. It’s more about perspective. Let me give you an example to clear up what I mean. There’s nothing wrong for a person to vehemently hate racism but in most peoples opinion there’s a lot wrong with hating someone just because they have a certain color skin. So hate isn’t always a good or bad thing and it always depends on the context much like every other emotion people feel. My guess is that your hatred for women at this moment is more a defense mechanism for something that has negatively affected you in your life so far. You have a few options on how to handle this. Obviously violence or self harm are never the appropriate response to this hate, I just want to make that crystal clear. If you want to repair the damage that has been done you can maybe start with something like meditation or therapy. These things force you to think about these situations that have happened to you in greater detail and that’s when you can use hindsight to highlight behaviors in people to avoid. This will allow you to get back into the dating world and be able to let go of hurt from the past to not pass it along to your new partner. Your other option is to swear off women, grow old and die alone. It sounds harsh and most people don’t like to hear it or accept it but there’s nothing truly wrong with this idea. You can look for happiness and contentment in your own life and provide it for yourself without relying on another person to fill that void. This can bring you much needed peace which is the best that some of us can ever hope for. Whichever you choose it’s entirely up to you and don’t let anyone tell you that either choice is right or wrong, decide for yourself. With either decision I would recommend spending some time by yourself and sorting through your own thoughts and feelings and getting a greater understanding of why you feel the way you do.\n",

      "Feel free to ignore everything I’ve said here as well. You have no obligation to listen to me at all. I just felt like I could lend a different perspective because I’ve been in your shoes. For a little background three out of my last four relationships I have confirmed cheating and the one that didn’t I still assume it happened based on my other experiences and that I simply didn’t confirm it. My first ltr ended after roughly five years because I had a bad feeling that something was really wrong and I ignored it for a long time and finally just listened to it. Turns out she had been cheating on me for years. The next one was my ex wife who I caught cheating in the act after barely a year of marriage. The last confirmed was with a woman at work who cheated with some of my other coworkers. Over the years I’ve developed a lot of hate and I still carry it to this day. The way I use my hate is in basic avoidance of women in my private life. I’ve chosen the grow old and die alone path myself. I’ve gotten some pushback from close friends and family about it but I won’t budge. I am who I am and I’m content with it and I’ve come to terms with never having a partner in my life. This isn’t an easy path to choose for most people and it may require a certain personality type to achieve but if you don’t mind loneliness then it’s really not bad. I can tell you with absolute certainty that there are women out there who are decent human beings. Whether or not those women will be attracted to you, I don’t know and no one does. There will be plenty of discomfort and hurt along the way no matter what path you choose but that’s life and it’s something we all have to learn to manage.

Make sure you’re making posts about anti-feminism, not anti-women, and they’ll probably stay up. Even just take a moment to throughly read the rules, and maybe you’ll have better luck composing your next post to be anti-feminism rather than coming across as misogyny. Or try posting in purplepilldebate instead, because I see posts with titles similar to your posts pop up there quite frequently, just make sure you use the CMV flair if you are making a statement rather than posing a debate.

But the thing is, the woman will be okay and she will have help to get back on her feet. Will it be rough for awhile? Most likely, but she will be okay, unlike men who are/where in abusive relationships. And not to mention being a housewife is a powerful thing. There is a reason why there is a saying, \"Happy wife, happy life.\"Some women can't work due to health or mental issues and then there are some, like me, who can afford to be a housewife. We have become housewives, knowing the risk that can happen and we still put faith into and trust our SOs.Maybe I'm just naïve because my husband is a wonderful man and would never do anything to hurt me. Not intentionally at least.So, as the post asks, what are your opinions about housewives?For \"Happy wife, happy life\" someone here explains where it comes from: [https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/425677/origin-of-the-saying-happy-wife-happy-life](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/425677/origin-of-the-saying-happy-wife-happy-life)\n",

      "Have you noticed that in society nowadays you can say the words “oppression of men,” and even when your audience believes you that women can be capable of this, they don’t bat an eye at accepting this is the way the world is now.  “Oppression of men” is an accepted fact of life, and no one seems to care.  As long as you can get on your high horse and rant about how men owned and controlled everything (supposedly) at some variety of times in the past, then sexism is 100% justified to a vast majority of people.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I said to you, “Hey, your great grandfather stole my great grandfather’s horse and buggy, so I’m taking your Honda,” does that actually seem fair?  As a society we need to get over this kind of bullshit.  Reversing sexism or reversing racism or reversing any “-ism” isn’t about allowing any person who is currently alive to go without any rules in society, so that they can run rampant until they satisfy their need for revenge.  This is the mental template these people are operating on though.  They truly believe it’s okay to punish ANY MAN for the perceived injury caused them by any other man.  They even think it’s fully acceptable to punish a male child for the supposed evils they never personally experienced, but read about in Women’s Studies and accepted as fact, from generations before they were born.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry for our generation that we have to live through a time when people pretend this is an acceptable way to right the wrongs of the past.  If you took a selection of random male adults and executed them with a firing squad, in a ONE-TO-ONE RATIO for every crime against women committed in the past, it would not equal the amount of suffering caused to the male sex by women in our current time, because the population total humans in the past was significantly smaller.  More people are collectively alive RIGHT NOW, than have ever lived at any time since humans became a separate species from Bonobos, 7 million years ago.  As recently as 30,000 years ago the entire human species on Earth was less than a few thousand people TOTAL.\n",

      "Therefore, every one of us men who is alive today, has more than paid many times over for the supposed crimes of our ancestor men.  We don’t owe anything more, collectively, than has already been taken in legalized bias against us.  Unless we, ourselves, are sexists who attack women for no reason other than their female-ness, then we don’t warrant the endless persecution of men by women that is currently the practice of our society, and is legalized in the court system.  Joining up with others on the basis of race, sex, religion, etc, and collectively bullying any group you identify as evil, based on THEIR race, sex, religion, etc, is what it means to be prejudiced and a bigot.  Why are we rewarding prejudice and bigotry of women now?  How is that any part of fairness?  How can that ever be anything but a travesty?\n",

      "The end of sexism is for everyone to cease ganging up on other people on the basis of their biological sex.  If you can’t identify with people of the opposite sex as being fellow humans who are capable of the same wants and needs that you are, then you are the threat to society, not the people whom you equate with everything evil.

The one thing I would say that unites them all is a compulsive, overwhelming desire to criticise and complain and in order to justify they utilise complex mental gymnastics in order to give themselves the moral high ground. Most people have heard women say they don’t want us to solve their problem they just want us to listen to them talk about it. If you look at the evolution of speech in Homo sapiens you’ll see that it evolved from women sharing information between their tribal groups specifically things like warnings about things which is a form of complaining. Talking about how they can’t go and pick berry’s in a certain area because there’s a Sabre tooth tiger there or how they are here having to gather mushrooms because their useless men couldn’t kill that giant ground sloth. We’ve evolved way beyond that now but women still have a deep primitive need to communicate problems to other women and so they have been engineering situations that allow them to keep doing it.

Feminism and other harmful ideologies have been quietly working in the background for decades, assembling influence, creeping into laws, media, schools, everywhere. It hasn’t always been so obvious that it’s a movement of hatred. For decades they’ve been working to make their ideology look like the voice of reason and truth to your average human, and it’s worked. So now, in the last few years, when they’ve upped the misandry considerably, the normal, otherwise sane people reluctantly go along because they’ve been convinced it’s the right thing to do by sources they’ve come to trust over the years. We have a lot of catching up to do, but fortunately, the suddenness with which feminism has gone public with its hatred of men and the family unit has woken up far more men and women than they expected. There is still hope. There’s no army with the power to utterly conquer truth. There have always been people who tried, but truth always prevails in the long run. If we stay on the side of truth and ensure we do not fall into the traps that have been laid for us, we will prevail in the end, it might be a decade away, but it will happen eventually. label: Not Cyberbullying\n",

      "\n",
      "> Women are horny, sure or they wouldn’t have sex. But not nearly as horny as men. There are multiple peer reviewed scientific studies confirming that men are biologically hornier than women. Libido is testosterone driven, which explains why men reach their sexual peak in their teens after which it gradually declines, where as women reach their sexual peak in their 40s when their estrogen begins to decline and testosterone becomes more impactful to their endocrine system deepening their voices and spiking their sex drives.\n",

      "> Most women can get laid any time of any day, with ease. Most men cannot. This creates an enormous disparity whereby even the most average women have the ability to sleep with practically any guy they want, any time they want. This huge imbalance leaves most men competing for even just basic attention, and even the ones who get it still have to go the relationship route and play all of their cards right, often being rejected or flaked on by women less attractive than them.z\n",
      "\n",
      "> This dynamic has persisted throughout our entire evolutionary history, and yet despite being easily observable even when you break down the basic science for them (sex drive is testosterone driven) they double down and insist “We WaNt SeX jUsT aS bAd!” as if it is some affront to their value as a human being and sentient creature.\n",

      "> No, it is simply biological fact. Look around, look at the numbers, look at the statistics. Men are insatiable, it’s not even close. Women are horny, yes or else they wouldn’t have sex. But it’s just idiotic to try to assert that their sex drive is anywhere near what a man’s is.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Women do not have to satisfy sexual urges on a daily basis and have much more self control. Plenty of women go weeks, months and some even years without sex and will do without before settling just to get off.\n",

Women can’t keep their hands off of me!” Yeah, no one believes you bro, sorry. Your Pete Rose lookin wife doesn’t count, of course she has to seduce you.\n",
      "\n",
      "> But for arguments sake, let’s say the sex drives are equal. The only remaining variable to explain the undeniable difference in how the two genders behave and how much more men appear to want women than vice versa would be the inherent desirability of women being greater than men. That would be an extremely chauvinistic statement to make, wouldn’t you say? This also wouldn’t explain why gay men are so much more hypersexual on average when compared to gay women.\n",
